# Boston Housing Project

Goal is to build a trained model on [Boston Hosing Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/) that predicts monetary value given certain input attributes such as total number of rooms, neighborhood poverty level, student-teacher ratio of nearby schools, etc.

## How to read the files in this project?

Any steps to a model is to understand data, please refer to housing.csv and use this [UCI link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.names) to learn more about how the data was put together.

Next, you could reference boston_project.ipny to understand the actions I took from downloading, understanding, and partioning the data for the model to developing, training, and validating the model to testing on a sample of data to evaluate model performance. 

Technically, you need certain python libraries such as [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), visuals.py (provided), [matplotlib](), [sklearn / schikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)

## **Why does this all matter?**

This was the 1st project from Udacity's machine learning nanodegree course which sets you to familarize how the rest of the course will go to this readMe on github. This helped me also understand the syntax and various important libs to python in deploying a model.


## What is this visuals.py file?

Your guess was as best as mine when I started this project so I won't share the secret just yet. No really, this was a supplementary file with the project. Peak inside boston_project.ipny as to why this matters and here is the hint it imports supplementary visualizations.

## FAQ

What if boston_housing.ipny is not loading? Try downloading the file and running Jupyter Notebook.
